# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with React

This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using React. Users with different roles (Admin, User, etc.) are granted different levels of access to the app, ensuring secure and appropriate access control.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-react-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rbac-react-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it. The page will reload when you make changes. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode. You can check the status of your tests and explore more details about running tests in the [React testing documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The resulting build will be minified, and filenames will include hashes, making the app ready for deployment.

For more information, check the [deployment guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/deployment.html).

#### `npm run eject`

This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! Use this command if you need to have full control over your project's configuration. It exposes the underlying configurations for Webpack, Babel, and ESLint to make customizations.

We recommend that you avoid ejecting unless absolutely necessary, as the default setup is optimized for small-to-medium projects.

## Features of the Role-Based Access Control System

- **Role Assignment**: Users can be assigned different roles such as Admin, User, and Guest.
- **Dynamic Route Protection**: The app uses role-based checks to control access to certain routes and components.
- **Login and Logout**: Secure login and logout functionality based on user roles.
- **Access Restrictions**: Components and pages are conditionally rendered depending on the user's role.
- **User Dashboard**: The dashboard is customized based on whether the user is an Admin or a standard User.
- **Error Handling**: Unauthorized users attempting to access restricted pages are redirected to a login page.

### Example Roles

- **Admin**: Can manage users, view all data, and access the admin dashboard.
- **User**: Can only view their own data and access the user dashboard.
- **Guest**: Can only access public content and cannot access user or admin areas.

### Default User Credentials

To get started quickly, here are the default credentials you can use:

- **Admin User**:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
  
- **Standard User**:
  - Username: `user`
  - Password: `user123`

- **Guest User** (limited access):
  - Username: `guest`
  - Password: `guest123`

These credentials can be used to log in and test the role-based access control. Once logged in, the appropriate pages and components will be visible based on the assigned role.

## Code Structure

Here is an overview of the code structure:

- **src/components**: Contains reusable components such as buttons, forms, and modals.
- **src/pages**: Contains pages like `AdminPage`, `UserPage`, `LoginPage`, etc.
- **src/context**: Handles user authentication and role-based logic using React's Context API.
- **src/routes**: Defines route protection and redirection based on user roles.
- **src/utils**: Contains utility functions for authentication, role checks, and more.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can follow the standard procedure for deploying React apps. Common platforms include:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Make sure to configure environment variables for production, particularly related to authentication and API access.
